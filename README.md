## 📦 Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/advanced-security-sim.git
   cd advanced-security-sim
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   Example `requirements.txt`:
   ```
   colorama
   ```

3. Add your target (for testing in **lab environments only**):

   ```python
   target = "http://your-test-target.com"
   ```

## 🛠️ Usage

Run the main script:

```bash
python deep_attack_simulator.py
```

All attack simulations and scans will be executed concurrently on the defined target.
